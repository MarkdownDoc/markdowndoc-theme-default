# MarkdownDocs default theme

This is [MarkdownDoc](https://github.com/MarkdownDoc/markdowndoc)'s default theme which means this is the theme that will be used when running MarkdownDoc without a custom theme.

This theme uses [Themeleon](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon) as a theme engine, and swig as a template engine, directly plugged into Themeleon.

Because this is likely to be the most used theme of all, it is not as simple as a theme can get. For instance, there is quite a bit of logic in both `index.js` and the Swig templates. Fortunately, you don't have to deal with that at all.
